		         <p>
			     IÉSEG belongs to the very closed club of French Grandes Écoles. Since 1997, it has been a member of the Conférence des Grandes Écoles (CGE), which currently includes 38 other management schools. In 2016, IÉSEG joined the very closed circle of schools (less than 1% worldwide) holding the "Triple Crown": EQUIS, AACSB and AMBA.The Financial Time ranks IÉSEG as the number one post-baccalaureate school in France and the 7th best French Master's in Management.

			          <h2>My future career </h2>
			         <p>
				     Thanks to the course of Sports Marketing, I realize that I could turn my passion into my dream job! Since then, I have only one wish: getting involved and get to know more about the Sports Industry! I would dream working as the Sponsoring Director of a French Club or Sportive association.
